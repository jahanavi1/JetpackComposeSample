Jetpack Compose is a modern toolkit designed to simplify UI development. It combines a reactive programming model with the conciseness and ease of use of the Kotlin programming language. It is fully declarative, meaning you describe your UI by calling a series of functions that transform data into a UI hierarchy. When the underlying data changes, the framework automatically re-executes these functions, updating the UI hierarchy for you.
Composable functions : A composable function is a regular function annotated with @Composable. This enables your function to call other @Composable functions within it. You can see how the Greeting function is marked as @Composable. This function will produce a piece of UI hierarchy displaying the given input, String. Text is a composable function provided by the library.
Modifiers : Most Compose UI elements such as Surface and Text accept an optional modifier parameter. Modifiers tell a UI element how to lay out, display, or behave within its parent layout. You may have already noticed that the Greeting composable already has a default modifier, which is then passed to the Text.
For example, the padding modifier will apply an amount of space around the element it decorates. You can create a padding modifier with Modifier.padding(). You can also add multiple modifiers by chaining them, so in our case we can add the padding modifier to the default one: modifier.padding(24.dp).
